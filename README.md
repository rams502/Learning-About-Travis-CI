# Learning-About-Travis-CI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thesurfermac/Learning-About-Travis-CI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thesurfermac/Learning-About-Travis-CI)

This repo is basically to explore Travis CI along with automating tests.
I have personally never written a test case and all my testing has been manual and this is an attempt to simplify some of the tests that I do manually.
